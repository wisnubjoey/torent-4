# Tasks: Vehicle Rental Platform MVP

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are REQUIRED ‚Äî every user story must deliver unit and integration coverage before merge.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Backend modules live in `app/Modules/{Domain}`
- Frontend pages live in `resources/js/Pages/{Role}`
- Shared UI components live in `resources/js/Components`
- Database assets live in `database/migrations|seeders|factories`
- Tests live in `tests/Feature|Unit|Browser`

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story work

- [ ] T007 Create PostgreSQL migrations for core tables and materialized views per data-model (`users`, `admins`, `vehicles`, `rentals`, `rental_items`, `drivers`, `rental_driver_assignments`, `availability`, `rental_events`, `rental_history_view`, `dashboard_metrics_view`).
- [ ] T008 Seed baseline admin account, demo vehicles, and sample availability in `database/seeders/AdminSeeder.php` and `VehicleSeeder.php`.
- [ ] T009 Implement shared repository abstractions and service bindings (`app/Support/Repositories/BaseRepository.php`, module providers).
- [ ] T010 Configure Laravel rate limiters for auth + booking routes in `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` honoring 5 attempts/hour OTP rule.
- [ ] T011 Add global sanitization middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/SanitizeInput.php`) and register in HTTP kernel.
- [ ] T012 Wire role-based guards/middleware and route groups in `config/auth.php` and `routes/web.php` (user vs admin prefixes).

- [ ] T014 Create shared dashboard metrics service skeleton `app/Modules/Rental/Services/DashboardMetricService.php` returning aggregated counts/upcoming deadlines.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies ‚Äî runs first.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion ‚Äî BLOCKS all user stories.
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Requires Phase 2 completion; enables authenticated access and dashboard metrics.
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 3 (dashboard navigation) and foundational availability schema.
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phases 3 & 4 (booking draft + availability) to complete lifecycle flows.
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories finishing.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1 tasks T003‚ÄìT005 can run alongside module scaffolding once Fortify install starts.
- In Phase 3, backend metric work (T022) and React dashboard (T023) can proceed in parallel.
- In Phase 4, availability service (T029) and calendar UI (T032) are parallelizable streams.
- In Phase 5, admin UI (T046/T047) can develop while scheduler/job logic (T049) and history services (T052) advance.
- All test tasks marked [P] may run parallel once relevant functionality is implemented.

### Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Run admin dashboard UI and rental history services in parallel once endpoints exist
Task: "Develop admin dashboard controller/views in app/Modules/Admin/Controllers/DashboardController.php & resources/js/Pages/Admin/Dashboard/Index.tsx"
Task: "[P] Implement admin vehicles management pages resources/js/Pages/Admin/Vehicles/Index.tsx with CRUD forms and policy checks"
Task: "Implement rental history repository/service (app/Modules/Rental/Services/RentalHistoryService.php) powering /user/rentals/history and admin timeline"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1 Setup.
2. Complete Phase 2 Foundational tasks.
3. Deliver User Story 1 (auth + dashboard) and run associated tests.
4. Validate OTP/password flows and dashboard metrics before continuing.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Ship US1 for early feedback on onboarding and dashboard metrics.
2. Add US2 to unlock availability browsing and booking configuration.
3. Layer US3 to finalize checkout, admin oversight, and automation.

### Parallel Team Strategy

1. Backend-focused dev handles modules, repositories, and scheduler.
2. Frontend-focused dev builds React pages/components with RTL coverage.
3. QA/automation engineer writes Pest/Vitest suites and browser harness.
4. Daily sync on shared services (Dashboard metrics, RentalService) to manage dependencies.
